# CHANGELOG

- 0.2.8.0 (2022-10-27)
    * Add a number of minor optimizations and INLINE pragmas:
        - The previous `INLINABLE` pragmas were insufficient to fully specialize
          functions. Add a bunch more. I believe they now do the job they were
          meant to.
        - Change the way we check for very short queues in `lbalance` and
          `rbalance` to avoid redundant size comparisons in the non-short
          case.
        - Make the fields of `Play` strict. I doubt this makes any practical
          difference, since `tourView` is `INLINE`, but in fact the fields are
          always in WHNF, so we might as well make that explicitly clear.
    * Fix a bug in `fromList`. It previously used the *first* occurrence
      of a duplicated key; it now uses the *last* occurrence, as documented.
    * Cleanup: refactor `binShrinkL` and `binShrinkR` into `bin`.

    * Bump tasty upper bound to 1.6
